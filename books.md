*July 6, 2019* - I first read CODE a number of years ago but wanted to pick it back up since beginning
Nand2Tetris/*The Elements of Computing Systems: Building a Modern Computer 
from First Principles* ([website](https://www.nand2tetris.org/) and [book on Amazon](https://www.amazon.com/Elements-Computing-Systems-Building-Principles/dp/0262640686/ref=ed_oe_p)) since it felt like they had so much in common.

From my perspective I've always loved computers and knew they were "just a bunch of zeros and ones" but didn't have a
clear understanding of how you go from 01010100010 to a website, video game or the entire world wide web.  Using a programming language
and operating system to do that? Sure.  But doing it from scratch?  CODE is a book that bridges that gap.

It starts with the simple premise of communicating with your best friend using flashlights. It then evolves this to telegraph relays, then logic gates then an adder and RAM.  From there you have all the basics you need to make a computer using Von Neumann architecture.  The great thing about the book is that it never underestimates the intelligence of the reader or handwaves things away.  It truly goes from the bare metal relays/vaccum tubes/transistors all the way up
to building a fully functioning computer complete with wiring diagrams, logic tables, etc.

Later in the book it goes through the actual history of computing from early analog and electromechanical computers through to the pioneers
of the field and the start of Silicon Valley.  Along the way the author describes real life microprocessors and how they were designed, why they stood out and
how they changed computing.

One of the amazing things about the book (at least to me) is that it was originally published in 2000 but you'd barely know it. While processors now
have multiple cores and RAM has grown much larger the basics are still as true as ever.

Given all that I'm glad I picked this up again.  I think there is benefit when learning something in going both top-down and bottom-up.  CODE is about the most bottom-up approach you can take to computing and I think it will be a great primer for the Nand2Tetris class referenced above.
