I'm currently a senior data analyst working at Nasdaq in Philadelphia.  I love learning and want to use this page
as a place to collect anything I find interesting or useful on a variety of topics including mathematics,
computer science, and data science.  It's also a space for any current personal projects
I'm working on.
