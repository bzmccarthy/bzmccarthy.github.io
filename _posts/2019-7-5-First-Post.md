title: A Fresh Start
---

I'm starting up this website to help me organize some of my personal, professional, and academic endeavours.

I'm currently enrolled in Georgia Tech's MS Analytics program but taking the summer off and working on a few independent
projects in the meantime.  I figured a website/blog would be a good way for me to record any interesting findings and thoughts I might
have so I can reference them in the future.

You can see [my GitHub page](https://github.com/bzmccarthy) which is pretty sparse at the moment but hope to fill it up with more content soon.
