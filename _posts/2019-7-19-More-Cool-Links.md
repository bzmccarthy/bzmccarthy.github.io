I really need to create a page to house interesting things I find that I want to come back to later.

In the meantime I'll just add it here!  The link today are to some trading strategies and the relevant code/data/papers for them.
Pretty neat and something I might want to explore.  The other possibility I was thinking of was a football simulator/prediction engine to
attempt to make some money with sports betting.
