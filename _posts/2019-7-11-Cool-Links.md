title: Some interesting links
---

I came across a couple of interesting links on /MachineLearning while waiting for my AWS job to complete today that I didn't want to lose.

The root post asked for "Controversial Theories in ML/AI".

[The AI Revolution: The Road to Superintelligence](https://waitbutwhy.com/2015/01/artificial-intelligence-revolution-1.html) The other blog posts on this site look quite interesting as well.

[The Ghost in the Machine: An Artificial Intelligence Perspective on the Soul](https://media.ccc.de/v/35c3-10030-the_ghost_in_the_machine) The other blog posts on this site look quite interesting as well.
