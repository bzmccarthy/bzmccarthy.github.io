### [Nand2Tetris](https://www.nand2tetris.org/)

*July 6, 2019* - I'm putting Nand2Tetris in Courses rather than Books but the accompanying text
[*The Elements of Computing Systems: Building a Modern Computer 
from First Principles*](https://www.amazon.com/Elements-Computing-Systems-Building-Principles/dp/0262640686/ref=ed_oe_p)
could be used on its own so straddles both.

Either way, it's something I've been wanting to complete for quite some time.  Given my summer break from GTech classes
I'd like to tackle this course in the coming weeks.  Putting this here as a placeholder for now and will update with
any notes or thoughts as I progress.
