Any interesting or informative courses I've taken or would like to take.

### [Nand2Tetris](https://www.nand2tetris.org/)

*July 6, 2019* - I'm putting Nand2Tetris in Courses rather than Books but given the accompanying text
*[The Elements of Computing Systems: Building a Modern Computer 
from First Principles]*(https://www.amazon.com/Elements-Computing-Systems-Building-Principles/dp/0262640686/ref=ed_oe_p)
which is self contained I think it could fit into either.

Either way, it's something I've been wanting to complete for quite some time.  Given my break from my Georgia Tech classes
currently I'd like to tackle this course in the coming weeks.  Putting this here as a placeholder for now and will update with
any notes or thoughts as I progress.
